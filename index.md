## Welcome ##
Thank you for visiting `plsmodeling.com`, a site dedicated to **Partial Least Squares** 
(PLS) data analysis methods. 


## Under re-construction ##
We're slowly brainstorming to bring you better and richer content about PLS. 
This means redesigning this website and rethinking about its purpose and scope. 

In the meantime, we want to provide a series of references and resources that 
should be useful for all the PLS community as well as for users and readers new 
to the PLS Universe.
