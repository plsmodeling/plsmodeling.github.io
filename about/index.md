## About ##


**PLS Modeling** is an online space dedicated to Partial Least Squares Data Analysis Methods. 

Hopefully, with the collaboration of other colleagues, soon we will be able to create 
a richer ecosystem for all PLSers. In the meantime, this website is my "two cents" to the community from which I've learned so much.
